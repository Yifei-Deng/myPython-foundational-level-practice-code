#Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist.

#Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called __init__.py.
#This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package
#So it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
